## 📖 Overview
Traditional crowdfunding for agriculture often suffers from a lack of transparency and high risk of fraud. This project introduces a **Smart Agriculture Crowdfunding Platform** that leverages Blockchain technology and a **Dual Verification Mechanism** to ensure that funds are used appropriately and investors are protected.

## 🛡️ Key Features
- **Blockchain Ledger:** Every transaction and funding milestone is recorded on an immutable ledger, providing 100% transparency.
- **Dual Verification Mechanism:** Implements a two-tier validation process involving both automated smart contract triggers and manual/IOT-based agricultural verification.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated fund release based on project milestones (Escrow-style).
- **Security:** Reduced risk of "rug pulls" or misappropriation of agricultural funds.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system is divided into three main layers:
1. **User Interface:** A dashboard for farmers to list projects and investors to fund them.
2. **Logic Layer:** The Dual Verification engine that checks project progress.
3. **Blockchain Layer:** Smart contracts (Solidity/Ethereum) handling the financial transactions.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for off-chain metadata)
- **Tools:** Truffle/Hardhat, Metamask
